So far only `Windows OS` is supported, but in the future it is planned to expand the possibilities of interaction with other systems.

The program will allow you to find out some important details and information about your operating system by typing simple commands, I thought it would be convenient to group everything you want to know about your PC into one program that is easy to use, and the instructions are right there, just go to [`Releases`](https://github.com/linkoffee/linconsol/releases), find release with the tag `Latest` and download `LinConsolXXX.zip` file (XXX = abbreviated name of your operating system).

> [!WARNING]
> I advise you to download the most recent versions, as the software is constantly updated, and older versions of the program may and most likely will not work correctly, keep this in mind.

In the future the program will definitely grow, new features, commands will be constantly added to it, and other various updates will be made.
